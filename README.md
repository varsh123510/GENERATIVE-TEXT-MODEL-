Task 4: Text Generation using GPT or LSTM 
Objective:
The aim of Task 4 is to implement a text generation model that can produce human-like sentences based on a given input or trained dataset. This task helps in understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP), deep learning architectures like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and transformer-based models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer).
Overview:
Text generation is a core application of NLP that involves teaching a machine to understand language patterns and create new text. In this task, you'll either train an LSTM-based neural network or use a pre-trained GPT model to generate coherent and contextually meaningful text. The goal is to analyze how well the model understands context, grammar, and semantic flow.
LSTM-based Text Generation:
If you choose LSTM, the process will involve:

Dataset Preparation:
Collect or use a text corpus (e.g., Shakespeare's works, song lyrics, movie scripts). Preprocess the data by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and tokenizing into sequences.

Model Building:
Build a sequential LSTM model using Keras or PyTorch. The architecture typically includes:

Embedding layer

One or more LSTM layers

Dense output layer with softmax activation to predict the next word or character

Training:
Train the model on sequences of words or characters to predict the next item in the sequence.

Text Generation:
Provide a seed sentence and let the model generate the next set of words based on learned patterns.

GPT-based Text Generation:
If you opt for GPT (like GPT-2 or GPT-3 via Hugging Face Transformers), you’ll use a pre-trained model and perform the following:

Setup:
Use Hugging Face’s transformers library. Load a GPT model and tokenizer.

Input Prompt:
Create a seed prompt that guides the type of text you want to generate (e.g., a story, paragraph, or code snippet).

Generation Parameters:
Set parameters like:

max_length: Total length of the output text

temperature: Controls creativity (higher = more random)

top_k or top_p: Controls diversity by limiting sampling to top tokens

Text Output:
Generate text using the model’s generate() method and display the results.

Learning Outcome:

Understand language modeling and sequence prediction

Learn to preprocess text data for NLP

Gain experience in using LSTM architectures

Get hands-on with transformer models like GPT

Explore how machines learn contextual language understanding
